## Overview

- Quantum Advantage: Quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers cannot solve in a reasonable amount of time.

- Hardware: 
    - Digital
    - Gate Time ( Clock Frequency )
    - Analog 

- Quantum Software
    - Adiabatic Quantum Computing: Optimization
    - Hamiltonian Simulation: Chemistry and Physics
    - Variational Algorithms: Optimization, Chemistry, Physics
    - Search Algorithms: Optimization, Data Science, Finance
    - Quantum Machine Learning

All concepts are viewed from the perspective of complexity theory and practical implemenations.

### Quantum Computer

- Set of controllable qbits
- Quantum gates are operations that can be applied to qbits
- Qbits are much bigger in size than classical bits
- Clock frequency must be lower than the electronic components controlling the qbits

Todays computers have a clock frequency of 100 MHz, where largers systems are projected tohave a frequency of 10 - 100 kHz.
